# OrbitProject
 
As of 12/9/2020, this is a project I am currently working on.  The original concept was created in my interest in self-generating systems and in learning some more about physics because I never had a chance to do that at college.  The plan is to create a self-generating system similar to a solar system with one central orb that randomly throws off chunks of itself to orbit around itself.  Currently, I am working on the gravity simulation but am running into issues trying to balance between realism and making it work.  The current issue is that bodies moving quickly just jump from one location to another and the faster they move the farther they jump.  This becomes a problem when the bodies start moving so fast they just jump past the gravitational fields of other bodies. This becomes most apparent around the edges of the screen where I implemented a ring of "reversed gravity" to act as the sides of a bowl to keep the bodies in.  The problem is that an object moving too fast will jump up the sides of this parabola and then start moving back even faster building more speed and especially teleporting to the other side of the parabola to gain even more speed and eventually it manages to move outside of unity's bounds causing the whole system to crash.  At this point, I am taking a step back from the project to do more research.
